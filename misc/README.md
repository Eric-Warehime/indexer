# Indexer E2E tests

`make e2e` runs tests with input generated by [go-algorand `e2e_subs` tests](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/test/scripts/e2e_client_runner.py).  As of writing `make e2e` is the _only_ automated validation of indexer's consumption of algod output.

## e2elive.py prerequisites
`e2elive.py` requires access to algorand-indexer and goal binaries. If you receive an error related to the algorand-indexer binary then you need to build the indexer from scratch by running `make` in the root of the indexer repository. This will insert a binary in the `cmd/algorand-indexer` directory, where `e2elive.py` expects it by default.

If the error is related to goal then the most likely cause is that the goal binary hasn't been installed as a package in the GOPATH system variable. Navigate to the go-algorand repository directory and run `make install`. If the error persists then run `export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)` followed by `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin` in order to verify that the binary is accessible.
